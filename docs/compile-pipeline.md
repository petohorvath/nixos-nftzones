# Compile Pipeline

This document describes the nftzones compile pipeline — the function chain that takes a `nftzones.types.table` value and produces an nftables ruleset suitable for `nft -f`.

## Motivation

The user-facing types under `nftzones.types` (zone, node, filter, snat, dnat, sroute, droute, policy, table) form an *input language* for declaratively describing a zone-based firewall. The compile pipeline is the function that *interprets* that language: lowering it to the libnftables-json shapes the kernel consumes.

Without the pipeline, the type system catches structural errors but nothing produces a runnable firewall. The compile pipeline closes that gap.

## Terminology

The pipeline (and the surrounding code) names the data-model levels consistently:

- **Group** — one of the rule-bearing collections on a table: `filters`, `policies`, `snats`, `dnats`, `sroutes`, `droutes`. Each group is `attrsOf <kind-submodule>`. *Not* used for `zones` and `nodes` — those are zone-level declarations and have their own terminology ("zone declaration", "node declaration").
- **Entry** — one item inside a group, keyed by name. `table.filters.allow-ssh` is an entry; the body field on it (`entry.rule`, the list of nftypes statements) is unambiguous because the wrapper is an *entry*, not a *rule*.
- **Direction** — `from` or `to`, the zone-name fields on an entry. Some groups are bidirectional (filters, policies, snats — both `from` and `to`); others are single-direction (`dnats`, `sroutes` have only `from`; `droutes` only `to`). Direction is the *entry's* perspective on the source/destination axis.
- **Side** — `ingress` or `egress`, the per-axis match fields on a zone (`zone.matchOverride.<side>`). Side is the *zone's* perspective on the same axis: a packet entering the firewall matches a zone's `ingress` side; a packet leaving matches its `egress` side. Mapped from direction via `internal.normalize.directionToSide`: `from → ingress`, `to → egress`. Two terms exist because each reads naturally only in its native frame ("entry's from-direction" / "zone's ingress side"); collapsing produces awkward constructs like "the to side" or "the egress direction".
- **Cell** — a concrete `(from, to)` instance of an entry produced by Phase 2's cartesian product. Same shape as the entry but with the listed directions as scalars instead of lists. An entry with `from = [ "lan" "guest" ]; to = [ "wan" "vpn" ]` produces four cells. For single-direction groups, a cell has only the relevant scalar (e.g., a `dnat` cell has `from = "wan"` and no `to`).
- **Slot** — one of two positions a cell occupies *within its sub-chain*, decided by the cell's resolved priority: `preChildCells` (emit *before* the child-dispatch jumps in that sub-chain) or `postChildCells` (emit *after*). The cutoff is at resolved priority `100` (`preDispatch` = 50 → preChildCells; default = 500 → postChildCells). Phase 3 buckets cells by `(chain, sub-chain, slot)`; Phase 4 emits each slot in order.
- **Bucket** — Phase 3 container holding all cells destined for one `(hook, priority)` placement, organized by sub-chain. `ctx.chainBuckets.<baseChainName> = { hook; priority; subChains; }`. Each sub-chain inside carries its own `preChildCells` / `postChildCells` slots. Phase 4 emits one base chain per bucket; the base chain itself holds only the dispatch jumps.
- **Section** — one of the four sub-keys of `zone.matchOverride.<side>`: `interfaces` / `ipv4` / `ipv6` / `extra`. A section either contributes a clause to a direction's match (when non-null and non-empty) or is inert. `internal.zone.getActiveMatchOverrides` filters out null / empty sections; `internal.emit.mkDirectionVariants` reads the remaining "active" sections to build the variant cartesian.
- **Variant** — one match-clause list within a `matchOverride.<side>` (or in a Phase 4 jump rule). Multiple variants → multiple emitted rules. `internal.emit.mkDirectionVariants` documents the section-presence cartesian for jump-match construction.

### nftables vocabulary

These are nftables's own concepts; nftzones adopts the same terms verbatim:

- **Hook** — netfilter attachment point. One of `prerouting` / `input` / `forward` / `output` / `postrouting` / `ingress` / `egress`. Field name in code: `hook`.
- **Chain priority** — orders chains attached to the same hook. Symbol (`raw` / `mangle` / `dstnat` / `filter` / `security` / `srcnat`) or int. NOT to be confused with **entry priority**. Field name: `chainAttrs.priority`.
- **Entry priority** — orders entries within their slot in a sub-chain (or pre/postDispatch in a base chain). Symbol (`first` / `preDispatch` / `postDispatch` / `default` / `last`) or int. Resolved by `internal.priority.resolvePriority`. Type: `primitives.entryPriority`.
- **Chain type** — `filter` / `nat` / `route`. Phase 4 derives this from `(hook, priority)` via `chainTypeOf`.
- **Base chain** — chain attached to a hook (carries `type` / `hook` / `priority` / `policy`).
- **Sub-chain** — regular chain (only reachable via `jump`). One per `(from, to)` pair in nftzones' compile model.

### Naming convention for chain identifiers

The same string travels from Phase 3 (as an attrset key) through to Phase 4 (as the actual nftables chain name):

- **`baseChainName`** = `"<hook>-at-<priority>"` (e.g. `"forward-at-filter"`). Computed internally by `internal.dispatch`. Used as the bucket key in `chainBuckets` *and* as the base chain's name in the emitted nftables output.
- **`subChainKey`** — local key within `bucket.subChains` (e.g. `"lan-to-wan"` / `"wan"` / `"lan"`). Computed internally by `internal.dispatch` from a cell's `from` / `to`.
- **`subChainName`** — full sub-chain name in the nftables output, `"<baseChainName>__<subChainKey>"` (e.g. `"forward-at-filter__lan-to-wan"`). Computed by `internal.emit.subChainNameOf`.

### Two framings of `(hook, priority)`

The pair shows up under two names depending on context:

- **Chain placement** — user-facing term, used in type docstrings (the `chain` override on `filters` / `snats` / `dnats`, typed as `primitives.chainOverride`). Describes what the override *does*: pins the entry to a specific base chain.
- **Chain attrs** — implementation term, used in `internal.dispatch` / `internal.emit`. Describes the attrset shape `{ hook; priority; }` carried alongside cells.

Same concept, different framings.

The Group / Entry / Direction trio shows up directly in `internal/normalize.nix`'s helpers:

```
expandWildcardZones          # table -> table
  └─ expandGroup             # one group's collection
       └─ expandEntry        # one entry, multiple directions
            └─ expandDirection  # one direction's zone list
```

## Public API

Two functions, both pure:

- `mkTable :: String -> body -> nftypes-table-value` — produces a composable single-table value (insertable into a larger user-defined ruleset). The `String` arg is the nftables table name; `body` is a raw `nftzones.types.table` body (evaluated internally via `evalModules`).
- `mkRuleset :: String -> body -> nftypes-ruleset-value` — wraps `mkTable`'s output in the canonical `{ nftables = [ … ]; }` envelope ready for `nft -f -j`.

Both consume one table at a time. Multi-table consumers compose externally — e.g. `nftypes.dsl.ruleset [ (mkTable "fw-a" body-a) (mkTable "fw-b" body-b) ]`.

## Pipeline phases

Four phases, each a pure transformation:

```
table
  ↓ Phase 1: normalize       lower nodes, resolve wildcards, validate
normalizedTable
  ↓ Phase 2: expand          cartesian product per entry (entry.toCells)
expandedTable
  ↓ Phase 3: dispatch + sort chain bucketing, priority sort
chainBuckets
  ↓ Phase 4: emit            per-zone sets, base chains, sub-chains, rules
nftypesTable
  ↓ wrap                      (optional) ruleset envelope
nftypesRuleset
```

Each phase has clear input and output shapes. Testable phase-by-phase.

## Phase 1: normalize

Three sub-steps, in order: lower nodes → resolve wildcards → validate.

### 1.1 Node lowering

`internal.node.toZone` converts each node to a zone definition:

```
{ name = "web-server"; zone = "dmz";
  address = { ipv4 = "10.0.0.5"; ipv6 = null; }; }
↓
{ parent = "dmz"; interfaces = [ ]; cidrs = [ "10.0.0.5/32" ]; }
```

Lowered zones merge into `table.zones`; `table.nodes` is cleared. After this step the rest of the pipeline operates on a single zone namespace.

### 1.2 Wildcard resolution

Phase 1 substitutes the wildcard zone (default `"all"`) in every entry's `from` / `to` list with the full set of in-scope zones (declared zones plus `settings.localZone`). The substitution + dedup is inlined inside `internal.normalize.expandWildcardZones` since it has no other consumer:

```
wildcard = "all"
allZones = [ "lan" "wan" "dmz" "local" ]
[ "lan" "all" "guest" ]  →  [ "lan" "wan" "dmz" "local" "guest" ]
```

`allZones` is computed once per table after node lowering, so nodes-as-zones are included.

### 1.3 Validation

Fourteen validators run after the compute phases, all in `internal/normalize.nix`. Each appends `lib.nameValuePair "<errorTag>" <message>` records to `ctx.errors` (or warning strings to `ctx.warnings`); the orchestrator aggregates errors and throws a single message listing every one, so users see all problems in one pass.

- **`checkParentRefs`** — every non-null `zone.parent` must resolve to a zone in `ctx.mergedZones` and must not equal `settings.localZone`.
- **`checkParentCycles`** — the parent chain must be acyclic.
- **`checkNameCollisions`** — node names must not collide with zone names (lowering would silently overwrite).
- **`checkSettings`** — `settings.localZone` and `settings.wildcardZone` must differ from each other and from any declared zone / node name.
- **`checkZoneRefs`** — every zone reference (in `from`, `to`, `node.zone`) must resolve to a known zone or `settings.localZone`.
- **`checkZoneMatchable`** — every direction-bound zone ref (`from` → ingress, `to` → egress) must point at a zone whose computed `match` is non-empty on the relevant side.
- **`checkChainOverridePlacement`** — entries with a `chain` override must land at a hook where their `from` / `to` zones are actually matchable (interface fields aren't valid at every hook).
- **`checkChainPlacement`** — every entry's resolved `(family, chainType, hook)` triple must be one the kernel accepts (via `nftypes.validChainPlacement`); rejects bridge nat, bridge sroute / droute (no `mangle` on bridge), route at non-output hooks, etc.
- **`checkRpfilterOverride`** — emits a warning (not an error) when `settings.rpfilter = true` but a user chain override already claims `(prerouting, raw)`; the synthesized rpfilter chain is suppressed and the user-authored chain is used as-is.
- **`checkPolicyUniqueness`** — at most one policy applies per `(from, to)` cell after wildcard expansion.
- **`checkSetNameCollisions`** — user `objects.sets.<name>` must not collide with auto-generated zone-derived set names (`<zone>_iifs|v4|v6`).
- **`checkInterfaceOverlap`** — distinct zones must not claim the same interface (ambiguous dispatch); ancestor/descendant pairs are skipped (intentional sharing in a zone hierarchy), and intra-zone duplicates in the `interfaces` list are also flagged.
- **`checkCidrOverlap`** — distinct zones must not have overlapping CIDR prefixes (ambiguous dispatch); ancestor/descendant pairs are skipped (intentional containment, e.g. a node lowered into its parent zone), and intra-zone overlapping CIDRs are also flagged. Family-aware via `libnet.cidr.overlaps` (v4 vs v6 never overlap).
- **`checkObjectRefs`** — every named-object reference in entry rule bodies, zone matchOverride content, and object bodies must resolve to a key in `table.objects.<kind>` (or — for `kind == "sets"` — a zone-derived set name). The walker lives in `internal/refs.nix`.

## Phase 2: expand

`internal.entry.toCells` does the cartesian product across an entry's directions. Directions present on the entry (`from` and / or `to`) are auto-detected, so the same call works for bidirectional and single-direction groups uniformly. The orchestrator maps over each rule group's collection:

```
filters.web-out = {
  from = [ "lan" "guest" ]; to = [ "wan" "vpn" ];
  rule = …; priority = "default"; …;
};
↓ toCells
[
  { from = "lan";   to = "wan"; rule = …; priority = "default"; … }
  { from = "lan";   to = "vpn"; rule = …; priority = "default"; … }
  { from = "guest"; to = "wan"; rule = …; priority = "default"; … }
  { from = "guest"; to = "vpn"; rule = …; priority = "default"; … }
]
```

Each cell preserves the original entry's body (`rule`, `priority`, `comment`, etc.) but with singular direction values. Single-direction entries (`dnats` / `sroutes` carry only `from`; `droutes` only `to`) produce one cell per scalar value of the direction they have. Output is a flat list per rule group: `{ filter, snat, dnat, sroute, droute, policy } = [ cells … ]`.

## Phase 3: dispatch + sort

### 3.1 Dispatch

Each cell goes to a chain based on its group:

| Group | Chain dispatch |
|---|---|
| `filters` | Computed internally by `internal.dispatch` — input / forward / output based on whether `from` / `to` reference `settings.localZone`. |
| `policies` | Same as `filters` — policies become tail rules in the same per-pair sub-chains. |
| `snats` | Always postrouting (`type nat hook postrouting priority srcnat`). |
| `dnats` | Always prerouting (`type nat hook prerouting priority dstnat`). |
| `sroutes` | Always prerouting (`type route hook prerouting priority mangle`). |
| `droutes` | Always output (`type route hook output priority mangle`). |

The per-entry `chain` override submodule on `filters` / `snats` / `dnats` redirects a cell to a custom hook + priority chain (e.g., rpfilter at `prerouting + raw`).

Output is a 2D buckets attrset: `{ <baseChainName> = [ <cells>... ]; ... }`.

### 3.2 Sort

`internal.priority.resolvePriority` resolves entry priority symbols (`first` / `preDispatch` / `postDispatch` / `default` / `last`) to ints (Phase 1 runs this for every entry; the pre-resolved values land in `ctx.resolvedPriorities`). Each chain bucket sorts by `(priority asc, name asc)`. Name is the attrset key from the original collection; it acts as a stable tiebreaker.

The cutoff at `100` (between `preDispatch=50` and `postDispatch=100`) splits cells into pre-dispatch (emit before the per-pair dispatch jump) and post-dispatch (emit after) — see Phase 4.

## Phase 4: emit

Composes the chain buckets and the rest of the table state into one `nftypes.dsl.table` value.

### 4.1 Per-zone sets

For each zone, generate up to three sets:

- `<name>_iifs` — `type ifname` set of interface names (deduped by `lib.unique`).
- `<name>_v4` — `type ipv4_addr; flags interval` of v4 CIDRs (coalesced by `libnet.cidr.summarize`).
- `<name>_v6` — `type ipv6_addr; flags interval` of v6 CIDRs (coalesced by `libnet.cidr.summarize`).

Each set carries the union of the zone's own interfaces/CIDRs **plus every descendant's, transitively**. A child zone is a refinement of its parent, so anything that matches the child must also match the parent's base-chain dispatch jump (the child is reached from there via the parent's child-dispatch sub-rule). CIDR sets are coalesced at compile time: exact duplicates collapse, subset overlaps drop (descendant `10.0.0.5/32` inside parent `10.0.0.0/24` → just `10.0.0.0/24`), and adjacent sibling prefixes fuse (`10.0.0.0/24` + `10.0.1.0/24` → `10.0.0.0/23`). The rendered set matches the live kernel state without relying on the kernel-side `auto-merge` flag. Empty sets are skipped. Per-direction match expressions used by jumps are constructed by `internal.emit.mkDirectionVariants` from these set names.

### 4.2 Base chains

One base chain per `(hook, priority)` bucket from `ctx.chainBuckets` (Phase 3). Default placements:

- **Filter base chains** — `input`, `forward`, `output` at `priority filter`. Header: `type filter hook <name> priority filter; policy <chainPolicy>;`.
- **NAT base chains** — `prerouting` (DNAT) at `dstnat`, `postrouting` (SNAT) at `srcnat`.
- **Route base chains** — `prerouting` at `mangle` (sroute), `output` at `mangle` (droute).
- **Optional `rpfilter` chain** — emitted only when `settings.rpfilter = true`. `type filter hook prerouting priority raw;` with one rule: `fib saddr . iif oif eq 0 drop`.

**Chain type derivation.** `chainAttrs` carries `(hook, priority)` only; `type` is derived locally in `emit.nix`. nftypes does *not* expose this mapping (only `nftypes.enums.chainType = [ "filter" "nat" "route" ]` and `nftypes.compatibility.familiesByChainType` for validation). Rule:

```nix
chainTypeOf = chainAttrs:
  let p = if builtins.isInt chainAttrs.priority
          then chainAttrs.priority
          else priorityIntsDefault.${chainAttrs.priority};
  in
    if p == priorityIntsDefault.srcnat || p == priorityIntsDefault.dstnat then "nat"
    else if p == priorityIntsDefault.mangle
         && (chainAttrs.hook == "prerouting" || chainAttrs.hook == "output") then "route"
    else "filter";
```

Covers all default placements (snat → `nat`, dnat → `nat`, sroute / droute → `route`, filter / policy → `filter`, rpfilter override → `filter`) and any user override that doesn't deliberately land on `srcnat` / `dstnat` / special-`mangle`. If users ever need to pick chain type explicitly, add an optional `type` field to the chain-override schema later.

**Rule order in a base chain:**

1. (filter only) stateful boilerplate (`ct state established,related accept; ct state invalid drop`) if `settings.stateful` (default true).
2. (filter input only) loopback boilerplate (`iif lo accept`) if `settings.loopback` (default true).
3. **Root-zone dispatch jumps** — one jump per root sub-chain (see §4.4). Built by `internal.emit.mkRootJumpRules`. Descendant sub-chains are reached through their parent's child-dispatch, not the base chain.

Chain `policy <chainPolicy>` is declared on the chain header (filter chains only), not as a rule. Cells with `preDispatch` / `postDispatch` priority symbols land in their sub-chain's `preChildCells` / `postChildCells` slot — *not* in the base chain.

### 4.3 Per-pair sub-chains

For each non-empty `(chain, from, to)` bucket, emit one chain. Inside it: sorted cells (filter / snat / dnat / sroute / droute rules) plus the tail rule from the matching policy if any.

**Naming convention:** `<baseChainName>__<subChainKey>` (double-underscore separator), reusing Phase 3's `chainBuckets` keys verbatim. The `baseChainName` is the bucket key from Phase 3 (`"<hook>-at-<priority>"`); the `subChainKey` is the local key within `bucket.subChains` (`"<from>-to-<to>"`, `"<from>"`, or `"<to>"`):

| Group / scenario | Sub-chain name |
|---|---|
| Filter `lan → wan` (forward) | `forward-at-filter__lan-to-wan` |
| Filter `wan → local` (input) | `input-at-filter__wan-to-local` |
| Filter `local → wan` (output) | `output-at-filter__local-to-wan` |
| Snat `lan → wan` | `postrouting-at-srcnat__lan-to-wan` |
| Dnat `wan` (single-direction `from`) | `prerouting-at-dstnat__wan` |
| Droute `vpn` (single-direction `to`) | `output-at-mangle__vpn` |
| rpfilter override `(prerouting, raw)`, `wan → local` | `prerouting-at-raw__wan-to-local` |

Verbose but unambiguous: each name is a literal concat of `chainBuckets` keys, so the name → `(hook, priority, from, to)` mapping is mechanical and auditable in the generated JSON.

**Body:** sorted cells (per `(priority asc, name asc)` from Phase 3) followed by the policy tail rule (if any).

**Rule body emission per group:**

- **filter / sroute / droute** — `cell.rule` is `list-of-statements`; splice as one rule.
- **snat** — `cell.rule.snat = { addr; port?; ... }` or `cell.rule.masquerade = { ... }` → single statement.
- **dnat** — `cell.rule.match = [...]; cell.rule.action.{dnat|redirect} = { ... }` → match conditions ++ action statement.
- **policy** — `cell.verdict = "accept" | "drop"` → single verdict statement (always the tail rule).

### 4.4 Jumps

In each base chain, emit one or more jumps per non-empty sub-chain in that bucket's `subChains`. Match conditions select packets belonging to the `(from, to)` pair using per-zone sets from §4.1 — or via `zone.matchOverride.<side>` slot content where the user supplied an override — and the verdict is `jump <sub-chain-name>`.

**Per-direction variants — *not* a single ANDed clause list.** In `inet` family, `ip <addr>` and `ip6 <addr>` clauses cannot be ANDed in the same rule: a v4 packet hitting `ip6 saddr ...` skips the rule entirely (and vice versa). So each direction emits **one variant per address family** that has a non-empty contribution, plus the optional interface prefix when the hook allows it, plus any `extra` section content the user supplied.

**Section resolution.** `mkDirectionVariants` resolves four sections per direction, in this order: override wins if contributing, else fall back to the auto path.

| Section      | Auto path                              | Override path                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `interfaces` | `inSet <ifField> @<zone>_iifs`         | `override.<side>.interfaces`   |
| `ipv4`       | `inSet <addrField> @<zone>_v4`         | `override.<side>.ipv4`         |
| `ipv6`       | `inSet ip6.<addr> @<zone>_v6`          | `override.<side>.ipv6`         |
| `extra`      | (none — no auto path)                  | `override.<side>.extra`        |

A section "contributes" when it's non-null AND non-empty. Empty list (`[ ]`) and `null` are equivalent — both mean "no constraint here" and let the auto path take over.

The `interfaces` section is **hook-gated**: dropped when the relevant `iifname` / `oifname` field isn't valid at the hook (defense; `checkChainOverridePlacement` should have caught it). The other sections are hook-agnostic.

> Note — *section* here is unrelated to the *bucket slot* concept defined in the Terminology section above. Bucket slots (`preDispatch` / `subChains` / `postDispatch`) are Phase 3 cell placements within a chain bucket; override sections are per-direction match-clause containers within `matchOverride`. Different concepts, same generic vocabulary; they never appear together in code.

**Variant construction.**

```
prefix   = ifsAtHook ++ extraSection
variants = optional (v4Section ≠ [ ]) (prefix ++ v4Section)
        ++ optional (v6Section ≠ [ ]) (prefix ++ v6Section)
result   = if variants ≠ [ ] then variants
           else if prefix ≠ [ ] then [ prefix ]
           else [ ]
```

The reachable cases (auto-path only — section-resolution
simplified to "no override anywhere"; the empty-zone case below
is unreachable in practice because `checkZoneMatchable` rejects
it in Phase 1):

| Zone has        | Variants emitted (per direction) |
|---|---|
| iface only      | `[[ <ifField> @<zone>_iifs ]]` |
| v4 only         | `[[ <ipFamily> <addrField> @<zone>_v4 ]]` |
| v6 only         | `[[ ip6 <addrField> @<zone>_v6 ]]` |
| v4 + v6         | 2 variants — one v4, one v6 |
| iface + v4      | 1 variant — iface prefix + v4 |
| iface + v6      | 1 variant — iface prefix + v6 |
| iface + v4 + v6 | 2 variants — each with iface prefix |
| empty *(unreachable)* | `[ ]` — defense only; `checkZoneMatchable` rejects empty zones at Phase 1 |

Where `<ifField>` is `iifname` (from-direction) or `oifname` (to-direction), and `<addrField>` is `saddr` / `daddr` likewise. With overrides in play, every cell can be replaced by user content; `extra` adds an extra family-agnostic prefix to every variant (e.g. `meta mark @<zone>_marks` for fwmark-defined zone membership).

**Cartesian product across directions.** For each sub-chain, take the cartesian product of `from`-variants and `to`-variants. Each pair becomes one jump rule:

```nix
fromVariant ++ toVariant ++ [ (jump (subChainNameOf baseChainName subChainKey)) ]
```

**Family-mismatch filtering.** When both directions are `(v4 + v6)` zones, the cartesian product produces `(v4-from, v6-to)` and `(v6-from, v4-to)` pairs in addition to the matched-family ones. These would be harmless at runtime (the kernel skips rules whose payload protocol doesn't match) but bloat the chain. `variantFamily` (in `internal.emit`) classifies each variant as `"ip"` / `"ip6"` / `null` (family-agnostic) by inspecting payload protocols on the variant's match statements, and `mkRootJumpRules` drops cross-family `(from, to)` pairs in the cartesian filter. Pinned by `tests/unit/internal/emit.nix`'s `testMkRootJumpRulesCartesian` — a `lan → wan` pair with both zones dual-stack emits 2 jumps, not 4.

**Hook-direction semantics** — interface fields are not always available; use `nftypes.compatibility.hooksWithOifname` (`[ "forward" "output" "postrouting" ]`) to gate the `oifname` clause. `iifname` is valid at every hook except `output`. The interface prefix is suppressed when the hook makes the field unavailable; address clauses are always allowed.

| Hook | `iifname` valid? | `oifname` valid? |
|---|---|---|
| `prerouting` | ✓ | ✗ |
| `input` | ✓ | ✗ |
| `forward` | ✓ | ✓ |
| `output` | ✗ | ✓ |
| `postrouting` | ✓ | ✓ |

When the hook makes the only available field unavailable AND the zone has no addr sets, the direction produces 0 variants. This case shouldn't reach Phase 4 because `checkChainOverridePlacement` (Phase 1) flags it; if it does (defense), the empty cartesian product drops the entire jump for that sub-chain — sub-chain becomes unreachable rather than over-permissive.

**localZone references.** Phase 4 emits no match clauses for the `localZone` direction (it's a sentinel — never has a `mergedZones` entry, never has zone sets). The chain dispatch already used `localZone` for chain selection; once dispatched, the sentinel direction adds no further constraint. Single-direction sub-chains (dnat / sroute have no `to`; droute has no `from`) get the same wildcard treatment for the missing direction.

Helper signatures:

```nix
mkDirectionVariants = { hook, direction, zoneName, active, zoneSets, localZone }:
  <list-of-variants>;  # each variant is a list of statements; `active`
                       # is the set of contributing matchOverride sections
                       # from `internal.zone.getActiveMatchOverrides`

mkRootJumpRules = { hook, baseChainName, effectiveSubChains, mergedZones,
                    zoneSets, localZone }:
  <list-of-rules>;  # base-chain jumps to root sub-chains only

mkChildDispatchJumpRules = { hook, baseChainName, parent, children,
                             mergedZones, zoneSets, localZone }:
  <list-of-rules>;  # in-sub-chain jumps to descendant sub-chains
```

### 4.5 User objects

`table.objects.<kind>.<name>` values pass through to the table's nftypes object containers. The compile pipeline fills in the `family` / `name` / `table` fields stripped at the type layer (the `asUserBody` helper in `lib/types/table.nix`).

### 4.6 Assemble

`nftypes.dsl.table family name body` produces the marker-tagged table value. The body assembles:

- `chains` — base chains + per-pair sub-chains.
- `sets` — per-zone interface and CIDR sets.
- `counters`, `quotas`, `limits`, `ctHelpers`, … from `table.objects`.
- `comment` — from `table.comment`.

## Design decisions

Originally an "open questions" list. Each entry below records a
decision point that came up during design plus the resolution that
landed. Kept in this file (rather than archived) because new
contributors hitting the same forks benefit from the prior thinking.

1. **DSL helpers vs hand-rolled nftypes shapes.** Use `nftypes.dsl.*` builders (with marker validation) or construct nftypes-typed attrs directly? DSL is cleaner; hand-roll gives more control.

   **Decision: DSL helpers only.** All rule-body / statement construction goes through `nftypes.dsl.*`; hand-rolled libnftables-json shapes like `{ match = …; }` / `{ accept = null; }` are forbidden. Tests enforce this via the shapes they generate.

2. **Chain naming convention.** Sketched as `fwd-<from>-to-<to>`, `in-<from>` etc. in the original draft; bikeshed before implementation landed.

   **Decision: `<hook>-at-<priority>` for base chains, `<base>__<key>` for sub-chains.** See "Naming convention for chain identifiers" in the Terminology section above. The original sketch (`fwd-…`) was abandoned — the `<hook>-at-<priority>` form generalizes across hooks (filter / nat / route / mangle / raw / security) and matches the bucket key in `chainBuckets`.
3. **Cross-reference walking.** Named-object reference validation requires walking statement trees (counter / limit / quota / ct-helper / ct-timeout / ct-expectation / secmark / synproxy / tunnel references inside `entry.rule` bodies, plus set / map lookups inside `match` expressions). Two paths:

   - **Special-case extractor** — pattern-match on the ~12 statement variants that can carry named-object refs, plus the expression-level set/map lookups inside matches. Smaller surface; brittle to nftypes adding variants.
   - **Generic walker** — recurse over any statement / expression tree, parameterized by a per-node visitor. Schema knowledge (which sub-fields of each variant are sub-statements / sub-expressions) lives naturally in nftypes alongside the schemas, so the walker would be upstreamed there (`nftypes.lib.walk.statements` / `walk.expressions` / `walk.rule`) rather than living in `internal/statements.nix`.

   `nftypes` currently doesn't expose a walker. Its `lib/dsl/structure/render.nix` walks the *table* tree (table → chains → rules) with stock `lib.concatMap` iteration but never recurses into statement bodies; `lib/dsl/internal/validate.nix` runs bodies through `lib.evalModules` for shape checking, which doesn't traverse content. What `nftypes` *does* expose are the inputs both approaches need: `nftypes.lib.types.statements` enumerates the variant tags, the `attrTag` shape (single-key attrset where the key is the tag) makes dispatch a one-liner, and `<variant>Body` schemas locate where references live in each body.

   **Decision:** implement the special-case extractor in nftzones first. One consumer, small surface, no speculative API design. If a second use case appears (Phase 4 emit doing structural transforms, a future linter, etc.), upstream the generalized walker to nftypes then — designing the walker API with a single consumer risks the wrong abstraction.
4. **Error aggregation strategy.** Phase 1 validators return error lists. Should Phase 4 emission also return errors, or is "if execution reached Phase 4, emission can't fail" reasonable? The latter assumes Phases 1-3 fully validate.
5. **Single-table vs multi-table compile.** `mkTable` takes one table; multi-table consumers compose externally. Reconsider only if a real consumer wants a single function call.
6. **Zone-derived auto-sets in user rule bodies.** Phase 1's `computeZoneSets` materializes `<zone>_iifs` / `<zone>_v4` / `<zone>_v6` into `ctx.zoneSets`, which Phase 4 emits into `table.objects.sets` at output time. A user could in principle reference one of those names from a `match` clause inside their own rule body (e.g. `right = "@lan_v4"`). At Phase 1 validation time those names are not yet in `table.objects.sets` — they're synthesized later — so a naive `checkObjectRefs` would falsely flag them as unknown.

    Three options:

    - **(a) Parallel namespace** — `checkObjectRefs` resolves names against both `objects.sets.<name>` keys and the predictable `<zone>_{iifs,v4,v6}` names derived from `mergedZones`. No schema change; gives users an escape hatch when raw `match` against zone membership is more natural than `from` / `to`.
    - **(b) Pre-seed synthetic sets** — add a Phase 1 sub-phase that materializes zone-derived sets into a virtual `objects.sets` view before validation. Cleaner separation but more pipeline machinery.
    - **(c) Disallow user refs to zone-derived names** — document `from` / `to` as the only sanctioned way to express zone membership in match clauses; explicitly reject `@<zone>_{iifs,v4,v6}` shapes inside rule bodies.

    **Decision: (a)** — same cost as (c), but preserves the escape hatch for users who need raw `match` against zone membership. `checkObjectRefs` will resolve names against the union of `objects.sets.<name>` keys and the predictable `<zone>_{iifs,v4,v6}` names derived from `mergedZones`.

## Status

All four phases are implemented, unit-tested, and wired through the public API (`nftzones.mkTable name body` / `nftzones.mkRuleset name body`).

The pipeline end-to-end:

`compile` pipes four sub-orchestrators; each one is itself a `lib.pipe` over per-phase steps:

```nix
compile = table:
  lib.pipe table [
    normalizeTable     # Phase 1
    expandTable        # Phase 2
    dispatchAndSort    # Phase 3
    emitTable          # Phase 4
  ];

# Phase 1 — internal/normalize.nix
normalizeTable = lib.pipe (mkInitialState table) [
  convertNodesToZones      # ctx.mergedZones
  computeZoneSets          # ctx.zoneSets   (consumed in P1 + P4)
  computeChildrenOf        # ctx.childrenOf (inverse parent map)
  computeRootZoneNames     # ctx.rootZoneNames
  collectAllZoneNames      # ctx.allZoneNames
  expandWildcardZones      # ctx.expandedGroups
  resolvePriorities        # ctx.resolvedPriorities
  collectZoneRefs          # ctx.zoneRefs
  checkParentRefs          # ─┐
  checkParentCycles        #  │
  checkNameCollisions      #  │
  checkSettings            #  │
  checkZoneRefs            #  │
  checkZoneMatchable       #  │ all append to ctx.errors;
  checkChainOverridePlacement  # orchestrator throws if non-empty.
  checkChainPlacement      #  │ checkRpfilterOverride is the one
  checkRpfilterOverride    #  │ exception — appends to ctx.warnings
  checkPolicyUniqueness    #  │ instead, surfaced via lib.warn.
  checkSetNameCollisions   #  │
  checkInterfaceOverlap    #  │
  checkCidrOverlap         #  │
  checkObjectRefs          # ─┘
];

# Phase 3 — internal/dispatch.nix
dispatchAndSort = lib.pipe state [
  groupCellsByChain        # ctx.groupedByChain
  buildChainBuckets        # ctx.chainBuckets
];

# Phase 4 — internal/emit.nix (reads ctx.zoneSets from Phase 1)
emitTable = lib.pipe state [
  emitBaseChains           # ctx.baseChains
  emitSubChains            # ctx.subChains
  emitUserObjects          # ctx.userObjects
  assembleOutput           # ctx.output  (nftypes.dsl.table value)
];
```

Public wrappers in `lib/default.nix` call `internal.compile.{mkTable,mkRuleset}` after running the user's body through `evalModules`:

```
nftzones.mkTable   name body  →  nftypes-table-value     (composable)
nftzones.mkRuleset name body  →  { nftables = [ ... ]; } (ready for `nft -f -j`)
```

Pending follow-ups:

1. Validate chain references in rule bodies. `checkObjectRefs` covers named-object refs (counter / set / map / etc.) but does NOT validate `dsl.jump <name>` / `dsl.goto <name>` targets. Two reasons today: (i) the chain-name surface in nftzones is internal (`<hook>-at-<priority>__<key>`) and not part of the public API, so users writing raw jumps to those names are working off-script; (ii) chains are synthesized in Phase 4, so Phase 1 doesn't yet know which names exist. Options if/when this matters: (a) add a Phase 4 post-emit validator that walks emitted rules and checks every `jump` / `goto` against the synthesized chain set, or (b) provide a public chain-name builder helper and validate at Phase 1 against that. Defer until a real consumer needs raw chain jumps.

2. ~~`sroute` emits an invalid chain type~~ **Resolved.** Upstream nftypes added `hooksByChainType` and the family-aware `chainTypeFor`; `internal.emit.chainTypeOf` is gone, replaced by a direct call to `nftypes.chainTypeFor`. Sroute now compiles to `type filter` at `prerouting + mangle` (mark-set then `ip rule` policy routing). Covered end-to-end by `tests/integration/scenarios/sroute-mark.nix`.

3. ~~`bridge` family rulesets silently misbehave~~ **Resolved.** Upstream nftypes added `priorityNameOf` and `chainTypeFor` with family-aware dispatch via `priorityIntsByFamily`; `internal.dispatch.canonicalPriority` is gone, replaced by `nftypes.priorityNameOf`. Bridge's priority constants (`filter = -200`, `srcnat = 300`, …) now canonicalize correctly. The Phase 1 family-allowlist (`checkSupportedFamily`) was replaced by the more general `checkChainPlacement`, which uses `nftypes.validChainPlacement` to reject any `(family, chainType, hook)` triple the kernel would refuse — catches bridge nat (no nat support), bridge sroute/droute (no mangle priority), and route at non-output hooks. Bridge filter+policy is covered by `tests/integration/scenarios/bridge-filter.nix`.
