/*
  NixOS module that compiles `nftzones`-shaped table bodies into
  block-form nftables text and feeds them through nixpkgs'
  `networking.nftables.tables.<name>.content` option. nixpkgs owns
  the systemd unit, the per-table deletion tracking, the atomic
  ruleset reload, and the build-time `nft --check` pipeline; this
  module is the typed translator.

  Two-stage function: the outer takes the `libnet` and `nftypes`
  libraries (applied by `flake.nix` with `importApply`); the inner is
  the standard NixOS module function. The module builds `nftzones`
  from the evaluating system's `lib`, so option types match the
  consumer's nixpkgs revision. Keeping these libraries out of
  `_module.args` means user-facing modules never see them as injected
  arguments; both are reached via their own flake inputs.
