/*
  internal/emit — Phase 4 of the compile pipeline, exposed under
  `nftzones.internal.emit`.

  Composes the rest of the pipeline state into one
  `nftypes.dsl.table` value via small focused helpers. Output is
  written to `ctx.output`.

  Pipeline pattern: each phase takes `{ table; ctx }` and returns
  the same shape, mirroring earlier phases.

  Phase pipeline (Phase 4, post-step-5 — every sub-phase below
  contributes one `ctx` artifact; `assembleOutput` rolls them
  into the final table body):

      { table; ctx (post-Phase 3) }
        ↓ computeEffectiveSubChains  ctx.effectiveSubChainsByBucket
        ↓ emitBaseChains             ctx.baseChains
        ↓ emitSubChains              ctx.subChains
        ↓ emitUserObjects            ctx.userObjects
        ↓ assembleOutput             ctx.output (nftypes.dsl.table value)
      { table; ctx }

  `ctx.zoneSets` is materialized once in Phase 1
  (`internal.normalize.computeZoneSets`) — the same artifact
  serves both Phase 1 validators (`checkSetNameCollisions`,
  `checkObjectRefs`) and Phase 4 emit (jump construction +
  `assembleOutput`'s final body), avoiding redundant evaluation.

  `ctx.effectiveSubChainsByBucket` is the same idea applied per
  base chain bucket: each bucket's full sub-chain map (direct +
  intermediate dispatchers) is computed once in
  `computeEffectiveSubChains` and consumed by both
  `mkBaseChain` (root-jump emission) and `mkSubChain` (chain
  body construction).

  ===== assembleTable =====

  Input:  `{ family; name; body; }`
  Output: an `nftypes.dsl.table` marker value.

  Thin wrapper around `nftypes.dsl.table family name body` so
  callers stay on the named-attrset shape. `body` may carry
  `sets`, `chains`, object containers, and table-level options
  (`flags`, `comment`); all are optional. As Phase 4 grows the
  body expands.

  ===== mkRuleBody =====

  Pure helper: emit one cell's rule body (list of nftypes
  statements). Dispatches on cell shape — no explicit group arg
  needed. See the `===== Output shape =====` section in
  `lib/internal/expand.nix` for the per-group cell shapes this
  consumes:
    - `cell ? verdict`         → policy (single verdict statement)
    - `cell.rule ? snat`       → snat with address translation
    - `cell.rule ? masquerade` → snat masquerade
    - `cell.rule ? action`     → dnat (match clauses + dnat /
                                 redirect action)
    - else                     → filter / sroute / droute (cell.rule
                                 is already a list of statements)

  All NAT/verdict statements are constructed via `nftypes.dsl.*`
  builders so they pass the marker-validation that prevents raw
  libnftables-json shapes from leaking through.

  ===== subChainNameOf =====

  Pure helper: build the full nftables sub-chain name from a
  `baseChainName` (`"<hook>-at-<priority>"` from Phase 3) and a
  `subChainKey` (Phase 3's local key within `bucket.subChains`,
  e.g. `"lan-to-wan"` / `"wan"`). Output is `"<base>__<sub>"` per
  design doc §4.3 — used both as the chain attribute in
  `body.chains` for sub-chains and as the `jump` target in base
  chains.

  ===== mkSubChainKey =====

  Pure helper: compose a sub-chain key from explicit
  `(fromZone, toZone)` components — the unpacked counterpart to
  `dispatch.subChainKeyOf` (which takes a cell). Used by
  `buildEffectiveSubChains` to fabricate intermediate-parent
  sub-chain keys without re-parsing strings.

  ===== isRootFrom =====

  Pure predicate: is this from-zone a root (no parent)?
  `localZone` is always a root by construction — the sentinel
  has no `mergedZones` entry. Unknown zones are also treated as
  roots defensively (consistent with the localZone case).

  ===== buildEffectiveSubChains =====

  Pure helper: for one base chain bucket, compute the full set of
  sub-chain records to emit — direct cell-bearing sub-chains
  plus transparent intermediate-parent dispatchers synthesized
  along each cell-bearing sub-chain's parent chain. Returns an
  attrset keyed by `subChainKey`.

  Why intermediates: only root from-zones jump from the base
  chain. A descendant zone with cells (e.g. `web-server`) is
  only reachable through a chain of parent dispatch jumps
  starting at its root ancestor. If any ancestor lacks its own
  cells, an empty placeholder chain still has to exist so the
  parent above can dispatch into it.

  Direct sub-chain records carry `preChildCells` and
  `postChildCells` from Phase 3. Synthesized intermediates are
  seeded with empty cell lists; emit fills them with just the
  child-dispatch jumps.

  ===== mkSubChain =====

  Pure helper: build one sub-chain body (regular non-base chain
  with a `rules` field) from one sub-chain record. Body order:

    1. preChildCells   — sorted (priority asc, name asc) by
                          Phase 3.
    2. child-dispatch jumps to children with content (one rule
                          per child × from-side variant).
    3. postChildCells  — sorted (priority asc, name asc;
                          policies appended last as tail rules)
                          by Phase 3.

  Sub-chains with no `from` (droute-style) carry no
  child-dispatch — hierarchy applies only on the from-side.

  ===== mkSubChains =====

  Walks every base chain bucket's effective sub-chains
  (see `buildEffectiveSubChains`), producing one sub-chain entry
  per `(baseChainName, subChainKey)` pair, keyed by the full
  sub-chain name (see `subChainNameOf`). Reuses Phase 3 keys
  verbatim so the name → `(hook, priority, from, to)` mapping is
  mechanical and auditable in the generated JSON.

  ===== mkDirectionVariants =====

  Pure helper: build the match-clause variants for one direction
  (`from` / `to`) of one sub-chain at a given hook. Returns a
  list of variants — each variant is a list of statements ANDed
  within a single rule. The cartesian product across both
  directions is taken in `mkRootJumpRules`.

  Why per-variant rather than ANDed clauses: in `inet` family,
  `ip <addr>` and `ip6 <addr>` clauses can't be ANDed in the
  same rule — packets of the wrong family skip the rule entirely.
  So one variant per address family with a non-empty set, plus
  the optional interface prefix when the hook allows it.

  Variant count per direction (where both interfaces and CIDRs
  are family-segregated by `internal.zone.genSets`):

    zone has        | variants emitted
    ----------------|-----------------------
    empty           | 0
    iface only      | 1 (family-agnostic)
    v4 only         | 1
    v6 only         | 1
    v4 + v6         | 2
    iface + v4      | 1 (iface prefix + v4)
    iface + v6      | 1 (iface prefix + v6)
    iface + v4 + v6 | 2 (each with iface prefix)

  Set references (`@<zone>_iifs`, `@<zone>_v4`, `@<zone>_v6`)
  point at the zone-derived sets emitted by Phase 1's
  `computeZoneSets`.

  Wildcard cases:
    - `zoneName == null` (single-direction sub-chain — dnat /
      sroute have no `to`, droute has no `from`).
    - `zoneName == localZone` (sentinel; matched by the chain
      dispatch already, no further constraint).
  Both return `[ [ ] ]` (one empty variant, contributing nothing
  to the cartesian product).

  ===== mkChildDispatchJumpRules =====

  Pure helper: build the child-dispatch jump rules for one
  parent sub-chain. For each child of `parentFromZone` that has
  a sub-chain in `effectiveSubChains` for the same `toZone`,
  emit one jump per from-side variant of the child's match.
  Targets `__<child>-to-<to>` (or `__<child>` for
  single-direction sub-chains).

  To-side is implicit — by the time control reaches a parent's
  sub-chain, traffic already matched the to-side at the
  chain-jump point. Child-dispatch only re-checks the from-side,
  narrowing into the more specific child match.

  ===== mkRootJumpRules =====

  Pure helper: build the dispatch jump rules for one base chain
  bucket. Walks each effective sub-chain; emits jumps only for
  sub-chains whose `from` is a root from-zone — descendants
  ride into their sub-chain via the parent's child-dispatch
  jumps, not via the base chain.

  For each emitted (root) sub-chain, computes the `from` / `to`
  direction variants and produces one jump per variant pair
  (cartesian product), dropping cross-family combinations
  (e.g. v4-from × v6-to) that nft refuses to compile in `inet`
  tables.

  Sub-chains with no `from` (droute-style) are also emitted from
  the base chain — they have no parent hierarchy to ride
  through.

  ===== mkBaseChain =====

  Pure helper: produces one base chain attrset (chainBody shape per
  `nftypes.dsl.table` docstring) for a given `{ family; settings;
  bucket; baseChainName; mergedZones; zoneSets; }`. Includes:
    - `type` derived via `nftypes.compatibility.chainTypeFor`.
    - `hook`, `prio` (priority resolved to int via
      `nftypes.resolvePriority`).
    - `policy` (filter chains only) from `settings.chainPolicy`.
    - `rules` — boilerplate for filter chains plus root-zone
      dispatch jumps:
        1. stateful   (`ct state established,related accept`,
                       `ct state invalid drop`) when filter chain
                       and `settings.stateful`.
        2. loopback   (`iif lo accept`) when filter input chain
                       and `settings.loopback`.
        3. root-zone dispatch jumps via `mkRootJumpRules` —
                       one rule per (root from-zone × from-variant
                       × to-variant) tuple.

  Per-cell rule bodies (whether for the parent's own rules or
  for descendants) live inside their respective sub-chains —
  see `mkSubChain`. The rpfilter chain is built separately by
  `mkBaseChains` and never injected into a user-authored chain.

  ===== mkBaseChains =====

  Walks `ctx.chainBuckets` producing the chain attrset for the
  table body. Threads `baseChainName`, `mergedZones`, and
  `zoneSets` to `mkBaseChain` for jump-rule construction. If
  `settings.rpfilter` is enabled and no user override has
  claimed `prerouting-at-raw`, synthesizes a dedicated chain
  carrying just `fib saddr . iif oif eq 0 drop`. A user
  override at `(prerouting, raw)` always wins; Phase 1's
  `checkRpfilterOverride` warns when both are set so the
  suppression is visible.

  ===== emitBaseChains =====

  Reads:  ctx.chainBuckets, ctx.zoneSets, table.{family, settings}
  Writes: ctx.baseChains

  Pipeline phase that wraps `mkBaseChains` and stashes the chain
  attrset on `ctx`. Reads `ctx.zoneSets` (produced in Phase 1 by
  `internal.normalize.computeZoneSets`) to construct the jump-match
  clauses.

  ===== emitSubChains =====

  Reads:  ctx.chainBuckets
  Writes: ctx.subChains

  Pipeline phase that wraps `mkSubChains` and stashes the sub-chain
  attrset on `ctx`.

  ===== mkUserObjects =====

  Pure passthrough: `table.objects.<kind>.<name>` flows into
  `body.<kind>.<name>` of the assembled table value. The type
  layer's `asUserBody` (in `lib/types/table.nix`) has already
  stripped `family` / `name` / `table` / `handle`; the nftypes
  renderer fills them back in from the parent table.

  Identity for now — placeholder for future kind-aware transforms.
  Named-object reference validation lives upstream in Phase 1's
  `internal.normalize.checkObjectRefs`.

  ===== emitUserObjects =====

  Reads:  table.objects
  Writes: ctx.userObjects

  Pipeline phase that wraps `mkUserObjects`.

  ===== assembleOutput =====

  Reads:  ctx.zoneSets, ctx.baseChains, ctx.subChains,
          ctx.userObjects, table.{family, name}
  Writes: ctx.output

  Final pipeline phase: rolls the per-artifact ctx fields into
  one `nftypes.dsl.table` value via `assembleTable`.

  Body composition rules:
    - Base chains and sub-chains share `body.chains` — keys don't
      collide because base chains use the bare `<baseChainName>`
      and sub-chains use `<baseChainName>__<subChainKey>`.
    - User-defined sets merge with auto-generated zone sets under
      `body.sets`. Name collisions resolve user-wins; a future
      Phase 1 validator should flag these at compile time.
    - Other user-object kinds (counters / quotas / limits / …)
      pass through as their own body field. Empty kinds are
      skipped so the output JSON stays minimal.

  ===== emitTable =====

  Orchestrator: pipes `emitBaseChains`, `emitSubChains`,
  `emitUserObjects`, then `assembleOutput`. Returns `{ table; ctx }`
  with `ctx.output` set. `ctx.zoneSets` is consumed (produced in
  Phase 1 by `internal.normalize.computeZoneSets`).

  /*
    Build the match-clause variants for one direction of one
    sub-chain at a given hook. Returns a list of variants — each
    variant is a list of statements ANDed within a single rule.
    Multiple variants → multiple rules (the cartesian product is
    taken in `mkRootJumpRules` / `mkChildDispatchJumpRules`).

    Why per-variant rather than ANDed clauses: in `inet` family,
    `ip <addr>` and `ip6 <addr>` cannot be ANDed in the same
    rule — packets of the wrong family skip the rule entirely.
    So one variant per address family that has a non-empty set,
    plus the optional interface prefix when the hook allows it.

    Section resolution (`active` is the user's active override
    sections from `internal.zone.getActiveMatchOverrides`):
      - `interfaces` section: `active.interfaces` if the user
        provided it, else auto `inSet <ifField> @<zone>_iifs`.
        Hook-gated — only included when `iifname` / `oifname`
        is valid at the hook.
      - `ipv4` / `ipv6` sections: user override if present, else
        auto `inSet <addrField> @<zone>_<v4|v6>`. Always valid
        at any hook.
      - `extra` section: family-agnostic user clauses (mark,
        vlan, cgroup, …); no auto path. Joined into the prefix
        when present.

    Variant construction:
      - prefix       = ifsAtHook ++ extraSection
      - one variant per non-empty family-specific section:
          [ prefix ++ v4Section ], [ prefix ++ v6Section ]
      - if no family sections contribute but prefix is non-empty →
        single prefix-only variant (interface/extra-only zone).

    Special cases:
      - `zoneName == null` (single-direction sub-chain — dnat /
        sroute have no `to`, droute has no `from`)         → `[ [ ] ]`.
      - `zoneName == localZone` (sentinel; never matchable as a
        zone — the chain dispatch already used it)         → `[ [ ] ]`.

    Phase 1's `checkChainOverridePlacement` and `checkZoneMatchable`
    guarantee a referenced zone has at least one matchable section at
    its hook, so the `[ ]` empty-result branch shouldn't fire for
    non-localZone refs. If it does (defense), the cartesian product
    in `mkRootJumpRules` / `mkChildDispatchJumpRules` drops the entire
    jump for that sub-chain.
