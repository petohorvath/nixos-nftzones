/*
  internal/placement — exposes chain-placement helpers under
  `nftzones.internal.placement`.

  Single source of truth for the per-group default chain attrs
  and the local-zone-driven filter/policy hook. Phase 1's
  `internal.normalize.checkChainPlacement` and Phase 3's
  `internal.dispatch.chainAttrsOf` both consume these — keeping
  them here prevents the two from drifting apart as new groups
  or hooks land.

  Exported:
    - `defaultGroupChainAttrs`  — `{ <group> = { hook; priority; }; … }`
                                  for non-filter groups (snats /
                                  dnats / sroutes / droutes).
                                  Filters and policies dispatch
                                  by host position via
                                  `filterChainHook`, so they have
                                  no entry here.
    - `filterChainHook`         — given a `localZone` and a
                                  cell-shaped attrset (with
                                  `from?` / `to?` fields), returns
                                  the hook the cell's filter or
                                  policy rule dispatches to:
                                    `to == localZone`   → `input`
                                    `from == localZone` → `output`
                                    else                → `forward`
    - `filterChainPriority`     — canonical symbol (`"filter"`)
                                  used for filter/policy chains.
    - `baseChainNameOf`         — `family → { hook; priority; } →
                                  "<hook>-at-<priority>"`. The
                                  bucket-key / base-chain-name
                                  format. Priority is canonicalized
                                  via `nftypes.priorityNameOf` so
                                  int and symbol forms of the same
                                  value collapse to one key.
    - `subChainKeyOf`           — `{ from?; to?; ... } →
                                  "<from>-to-<to>"` / `"<from>"` /
                                  `"<to>"`. The local sub-chain
                                  key inside a bucket; accepts
                                  cell-shaped attrsets (extra
                                  fields ignored).

  Wired into the surface from `lib/internal/default.nix` as a
  layer-0 leaf with no inter-module dependencies.
