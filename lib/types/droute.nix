  types/droute — exposes droute-related types under `nftzones.types`.

  Exported types:
    - `droute`         — submodule for one droute definition
    - `drouteName`     — string identifier for a droute
    - `drouteRule`     — list of nftypes statements (mangle / match
                         body)
    - `droutePriority` — symbol-or-int entry sort key (lower runs first)
    - `drouteComment`  — optional free-form comment

  A droute is a destination-zone-keyed route-mangling rule that
  applies in output (`type route hook output priority mangle`). It
  marks or mangles locally-generated outbound packets based on
  destination zone, triggering a routing re-evaluation when the
  chain exits — used for mark-based policy routing of local
  traffic (e.g. multi-WAN selection by destination). Consumers
  wire it as `lib.mkOption { type = lib.types.attrsOf
  nftzones.types.droute; }`.

  Why no `from`: output-hook chains fire only on locally-generated
  packets, so the source zone is always `settings.localZone`.
  Including `from = [ <localZone> ]` as boilerplate would add
  noise without informing dispatch.

  `to` uses the shared `zoneNames` type and the same wildcard /
  localZone behaviour as filter / snat / dnat / sroute — see
  `types/filter.nix` for the full discussion.

  `drouteRule` is a flat list of nftypes statements — typically
  match conditions plus mangle statements like `meta mark set N`.
  No verdict is expected; the chain triggers routing
  re-evaluation, not a verdict.

  `droutePriority` orders rules sharing the same `to` zone: lower
  values run first.

  Example:
    options.droutes = lib.mkOption {
      type = lib.types.attrsOf nftzones.types.droute;
      default = { };
    };

    config.droutes.lan-via-vpn = {
      to = [ "lan-remote" ];
      rule = [
        (mangle meta.mark 200)
      ];
      comment = "local traffic to remote-lan via VPN";
    };

            The droute's name. Defaults to the attribute name in

            Destination zones for the droute — non-empty. Each
            entry is either a declared zone name, the configured

            `settings.wildcardZone` (default `"all"`); resolution
            is enforced at module level, not by the type.
