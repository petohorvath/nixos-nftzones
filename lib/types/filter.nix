/*
  types/filter — exposes filter-related types under `nftzones.types`.

  Exported types:
    - `filter`         — submodule for one filter definition
    - `filterName`     — string identifier for a filter
    - `filterRule`     — list of nftypes DSL statements (rule body)
    - `filterPriority` — symbol-or-int entry sort key (lower runs first)
    - `filterComment`  — optional free-form comment

  A filter is a directed `from → to` zone-pair rule. It carries a
  rule body (matches plus a verdict, expressed as nftypes
  statements), an ordering key, and an optional free-form comment.
  Consumers wire it as `lib.mkOption { type = lib.types.attrsOf
  nftzones.types.filter; }`.

  `from` / `to` use the shared `zoneNames` type (non-empty list
  of `zoneName` strings) — see `lib/types/zone.nix`. Whether each
  entry resolves to a declared zone, `settings.localZone`, or
  `settings.wildcardZone` is a cross-cutting check that belongs in
  module assertions on the enclosing `filters` attrset.

  `filterRule` entries pass through nftypes' attrTag validation, so
  consumers cannot smuggle hand-rolled libnftables-json shapes. The
  list spans both match conditions (e.g. `eq tcp.dport 22`) and the
  verdict (e.g. `accept`); entries are spliced conjunctively into a
  single nftables rule.

  `filterPriority` orders rules sharing the same `(from, to)` pair
  — an nftzones-internal sort key, NOT the nftables chain priority.
  Either a symbol (`first` / `preDispatch` / `postDispatch` /
  `default` / `last`) or any int. Default `"default"` (= 500).
  Cells are emitted in `(priority asc, name asc)` order. The
  cutoff at 100 splits cells into pre-dispatch (< 100, emitted
  before per-zone matchers) and post-dispatch (>= 100, after).

  The `chain` field is the shared `primitives.chainOverride`
  (optional `{ hook; priority; }` submodule). By default
  (`chain = null`), the entry is dispatched to `input`,
  `forward`, or `output` based on `settings.localZone`:
    - `to` references `settings.localZone` → `input`
    - `from` references `settings.localZone` → `output`
    - neither → `forward`
  Setting `chain` pins the entry to a specific base chain (useful
  for rpfilter at `prerouting + raw`). At a non-default hook, `to`
  and `from` may not have their usual match semantics (notably
  `to` is meaningless in `prerouting` since routing hasn't
  happened yet); the compiler treats them as match expressions
  where applicable and skips them otherwise.

  Example:
    options.filters = lib.mkOption {
      type = lib.types.attrsOf nftzones.types.filter;
      default = { };
    };

    config.filters.allow-ssh = {
      from = [ "wan" ];
      to = [ "local" ];
      rule = [
        (eq tcp.dport 22)
        accept
      ];
      comment = "ssh from anywhere";
    };
    config.filters.web-out = {
      from = [ "lan" ];
      to = [ "wan" "vpn" ];
      rule = [
        (eq tcp.dport 443)
        accept
      ];
    };

            `settings.localZone` (default `"local"`), or

            Body of the nftables rule, expressed as a list of
            nftypes DSL statements. Spans both match conditions and
            the verdict; entries are spliced conjunctively into a

            Sort key for ordering rules within their chain.
            Either a symbol (`first` / `preDispatch` /
            `postDispatch` / `default` / `last`) or any int.
            Cells are emitted in `(priority asc, name asc)` order.
            See `primitives.entryPriority` for symbol → int

            Override the chain placement. `null` (the default)
            dispatches to `input` / `forward` / `output` based on
            whether `from` / `to` reference `settings.localZone`.
            A submodule pins the entry to a specific base chain —
            useful for placements like rpfilter
            (`chain = { hook = "prerouting"; priority = "raw"; }`).
            At non-default hooks, `to` / `from` may lose their
            usual match meaning (notably `to` in `prerouting`);
            the compiler emits matches where applicable.

            rule. `null` (the default) emits no comment.
