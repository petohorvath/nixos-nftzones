/*
  types/sroute — exposes sroute-related types under `nftzones.types`.

  Exported types:
    - `sroute`         — submodule for one sroute definition
    - `srouteName`     — string identifier for an sroute
    - `srouteRule`     — list of nftypes statements (mangle / match
                         body)
    - `sroutePriority` — symbol-or-int entry sort key (lower runs first)
    - `srouteComment`  — optional free-form comment

  An sroute is a source-zone-keyed route-mangling rule that applies
  in prerouting (`type route hook prerouting priority mangle`). It
  marks or mangles incoming packets based on source zone,
  triggering a routing re-evaluation when the chain exits — used
  for mark-based policy routing of forwarded traffic. Consumers
  wire it as `lib.mkOption { type = lib.types.attrsOf
  nftzones.types.sroute; }`.

  Why no `to`: prerouting runs before the routing decision, so the
  destination zone (which depends on routing) isn't determined
  when the entry's emitted rules fire. Same structural reason dnat omits `to`.

  `from` uses the shared `zoneNames` type and the same wildcard
  / localZone behaviour as filter / snat / dnat — see
  `types/filter.nix` for the full discussion.

  `srouteRule` is a flat list of nftypes statements — typically
  match conditions plus mangle statements like `meta mark set N`.
  No verdict is expected; the chain triggers routing
  re-evaluation, not a verdict.

  `sroutePriority` orders rules sharing the same `from` zone:
  lower values run first.

  Example:
    options.sroutes = lib.mkOption {
      type = lib.types.attrsOf nftzones.types.sroute;
      default = { };
    };

    config.sroutes.guest-via-vpn = {
      from = [ "guest" ];
      rule = [
        (mangle meta.mark 100)
      ];
      comment = "guest traffic policy-routed via VPN";
    };

            The sroute's name. Defaults to the attribute name in

            Source zones for the sroute — non-empty. Each entry
            is either a declared zone name, the configured

            `settings.wildcardZone` (default `"all"`); resolution
            is enforced at module level, not by the type.
