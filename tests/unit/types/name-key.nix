/*
  Unit tests for the `name == <attribute key>` invariant across the
  object types under `lib/types/`.

  Two properties, both consequences of dropping `readOnly` from each
  type's `name` sub-option:

    1. Copy-safe: an *evaluated* submodule can be copied between two
       `attrsOf <type>` options (the facade-wrapper pattern — see the
       downstream context in the fix) and its `.name` forced without
       the module system rejecting the copied, key-derived definition.
       This is the regression guard: it throws on the pre-fix
       `readOnly = true` code and passes now.

    2. Invariant preserved: for the keyed object types, an explicit
       `name` that differs from the enclosing key is rejected by
       `internal.normalize.checkNameKeyMismatch`. The table's name is
       instead a projection of its real attr key, derived at the
       module / `mkTable` boundary — a divergent `name` is overridden
       by the key, not rejected, so a facade can forward a whole
       evaluated table under any key.

  Same `testFoo = { expr; expected; }` shape as every other unit
  test; aggregated by `tests/unit/default.nix`.

    Reproduce the downstream facade-wrapper collision: declare two

    On the pre-fix `readOnly = true` code this throws ("… is
    read-only, but it's set multiple times"); after the fix the two
    equal key-derived values merge and it resolves to the key ("z").

    Only `.name` is forced, so required sibling fields (e.g.
    `node.zone`) are never evaluated and an empty body suffices for
    every type.
