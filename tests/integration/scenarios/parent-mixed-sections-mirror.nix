/*
  Mirror of the mixed-section hierarchy scenario — an
  interface-only child zone under a cidrs-only parent. The
  parent's own gate cannot see the child's traffic (an address
  gate never matches by interface), so the fix must both leave
  the parent's own v4 variant un-narrowed *and* let the child's
  traffic reach the parent's rules: the descendant-contributed
  `lan_iifs` set rides a standalone family-agnostic dispatch
  variant instead of ANDing into the v4 gate.

  Pre-fix, the descendant-only interface set joined the prefix
  and the parent's dispatch collapsed to
  `iifname @lan_iifs ip saddr @lan_v4` — parent traffic on any
  other interface and child traffic outside the parent's CIDR
  both fell through to default-drop.
