/*
  Transitive zone-set scenario — confirms that a parent zone's
  auto-generated `_iifs` / `_v4` sets include every descendant's
  interfaces / CIDRs, not just the parent's own. This is the
  fix for the security audit's M1 finding: with `chainPolicy =
  "accept"` and a wildcard `from = [ "all" ]` deny policy, only
  root zones get base-chain dispatch jumps — so unless the
  parent zone's match set transitively covers descendant
  traffic, the descendant escapes the deny.

  Concretely: a packet from `192.168.0.5` on `guest0` matches
  `@lan_iifs` (which now contains both `lan0` and `guest0`),
  takes the base-chain jump into `lan`'s sub-chain, and the
  wildcard deny policy fires there. Pre-fix, `@lan_iifs`
  contained only `lan0`; guest traffic skipped lan's sub-chain
  entirely and fell through to `policy accept`.
