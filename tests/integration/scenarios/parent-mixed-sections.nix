/*
  Mixed-section hierarchy scenario — an address-only node attached
  to an interface-only parent zone, the default shape whenever
  `nodes` is used on a physical-interface zone. Pins the hierarchy
  invariant that adding a descendant never *narrows* what the
  ancestor matches: the parent's base-chain dispatch stays gated
  by `iifname @lan_iifs` alone (the node's traffic arrives on the
  parent's interface and rides the same gate), and the node
  refines *inside* the parent's pair chain via a child-dispatch
  jump on its own `@web_v4` set, with the parent's rules as
  fallback.

  Regression guard for the cross-family narrowing bug: the
  descendant-only `lan_v4` union set used to be ANDed into the
  parent's dispatch gate (`iifname @lan_iifs ip saddr @lan_v4`),
  so `lan` matched *only* the node's traffic and every other host
  on `lan0` fell through to the chain's default-drop.
