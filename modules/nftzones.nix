/*
  NixOS module that compiles `nftzones`-shaped table bodies into
  block-form nftables text and feeds them through nixpkgs'
  `networking.nftables.tables.<name>.content` option. nixpkgs owns
  the systemd unit, the per-table deletion tracking, the atomic
  ruleset reload, and the build-time `nft --check` pipeline; this
  module is the typed translator.

  Two-stage function: the outer takes the `nftzones` and `nftypes`
  libs (applied by `flake.nix` from the host system's `libBySystem`
  and the `nftypes` flake input); the inner is the standard NixOS
  module function. Keeping these libs out of `_module.args` means
  user-facing modules never see them as injected arguments — both
  are reached via their own flake inputs.
